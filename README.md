# Phils Benthic Purity Swap

Highly inspired by [BloomPuritySwap](https://thunderstore.io/package/MarkTullius/BloomPuritySwap/) but slightly changed since I wasn't satisfied with how BloomPuritySwap implemented this swap.

### Benthic Bloom
- Changes Tier to Lunar
- Upgrades items as normal
- Reduces luck by 1 per Bloom
- No longer Corrupts 57 Leaf Clovers

### Purity
- Changes Tier to Void Red
- Reduces cooldowns as normal
- No longer reduces luck
- Corrupts all 57 Leaf Clovers
